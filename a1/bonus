For my bonus, I explored additional preprocesing steps in including minmax scaling and
standard scaling (mean and std dev removal).

I additionally explored another classifier, multinomialNB.
Finally, I optimized the parameters for each using randomized grid search to see how they all perform.
The results for these components are in a1_bonus.txt and are written in the a1_classify.py under the function
classify_bonus.

I also explored LDA, a Bayesian version of LSA using Dirichlet priors and compared it with LSA.
The analysis of these features is in a1_bonus_lda.txt
I then train the best classifier on the LDA features to see if there is any improvement.
The results are in a1_bonus_class_LDA.txt

For my bonus, I explored additional preprocesing steps in including minmax scaling and
standard scaling (mean and std dev removal).

I additionally explored another classifier, multinomialNB.
Finally, I optimized the parameters for each using randomized grid search to see how they all perform.

I also explored LDA, a Bayesian version of LSA using Dirichlet priors and compared it with LSA.
Please see a1_bonus.txt for the classification bonus and a1_bonus_LDA for the LDA bonus results.
